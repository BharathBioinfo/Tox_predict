# Learning Toxicity from admetSAR Database

The [admetSAR database](http://lmmd.ecust.edu.cn/admetsar2) was created by the research group of Prof. Yun Tang at East China University of Science and Technology
to provide data about properties relevant to drug screening.
These notebooks focus on recreating their models so that we can use them in high-throughput to screen millions of molecules.
